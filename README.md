# Overview

This app is a very basic android app that lets the user input flashcards and then allows them to study them by mixing up the order of the cards and having the user go through them. While it is very limited in scope
I was able to learn the very basics of Java and was able to decently pick up the android studio platform.

# Development Environment

I initially was going to write this app in Kotlin but I was having a very hard time wrapping my head around it. I knew a decent amount of people that knew Java already so I decided to use Java insted.
Android studio the latest version was very finnicky but I was able to find very helpful documentation and videos on 2021.3.1 Version Dolphin. With this version it was nice and easy to program.

# Future Work

* Add a save feature so you can make sets and come back to them.
* I really want to add a game aspect into it, its right now very simple and just cut and dry flashcards but adding a game would be fun. 
* Potentially make it run faster and optimize it more. It seems kinda clunky and even the UI isn't the best.
